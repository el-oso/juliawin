We decided to develop the Python, Julia, and Batch sections seperately, and deploy them as a single cross-platform file.

The output is the concatenation:

 * `julia-win-installer.bat` +
 * `julia-win-installer.jl` +
 * `julia-win-installer.py`

We compiled it using `bat-python-julia-compiler.py`, according to the template `bat-python-julia-template.txt`.
